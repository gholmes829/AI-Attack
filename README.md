# AI-Attack
AI Survival Game

I created this game as a fun project to better understand basic AI and to practice OOP skills.
I explored and implemented:
* A* and HPA* hierarchical pathfinding algorithms
* Collaborative awareness and multi-agent dynamic navigation

Included in /dist is a stand-alone executable .exe version so that user does not need Python environment to run.

Enjoy!
